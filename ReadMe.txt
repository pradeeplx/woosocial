Make your online shop a thriving social community and increase exposure of your products with this powerful new add-on for the ever-popular WordPress plugin, WooCommerce.

WooSocial has been created to encourage your customers to like products and connect with friends to view their activity; all within your online store. Your customers will be given user profiles in order to keep track of the products they love and check out the things their friends are loving, too.

WooSocial gives each user an admin customisable URL where their profile is displayed, and it also allows them to access the combined activity feeds of all users they follow, in order to keep track of the latest trends. Your customers will have the chance to see what their friends are liking and who they’re following, as well as gather gift ideas for friends and family based on what they’ve liked. It’s a fantastic way to expose your products to a wider audience, generate more views to your store and target social-savvy, highly engaged consumers.
